				<p>I Love to Swim! is a delightful rhyme told from the perspective of a little boy whose mother brings him to swimming lessons. He shares his love of swimming in Why I love swimming. When I'm in the water I'm elementally myself, floating free of any worries, selfconsciousness or physical discomfort.I love swimming because I feel at peace in the water. It makes me feel younger, more alive, more relaxed, more at ease than almost anywhere ...I started learning how to swim when I was five years old and I have been swimming ever since. There are many reasons why I love swimming but I’ll just share a few with you, and maybe I can even encourage you to go for a swim. The first reason that I love swimming is that it can be extremely relaxing.I started learning how to swim when I was five years old and I have been swimming ever since.
